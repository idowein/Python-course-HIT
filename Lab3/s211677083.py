# ### question 1
# 
# Open new code cell below this one and print the results of next expressions (each expression in his on line):
# 
#     1) 1+2
# 
#     2) 5*10
# 
#     3) 5*10+7
# 
#     4) 5*(10+7)
# 
#     5) 10**2
# 
#     6) 9**0.5
# 
#     7) 77%2
# 
#     8) 18//5

# %%
print(1+2)
print(5*10)
print(5*10+7)
print(5*(10+7))
print(10**2)
print(9**0.5)
print(77%2)
print(18//5)

# %% [markdown]
# ### question 2
# Open new code cell below this one and use at least 4 mathematecal opretors on any numerical valus you prefer to get 85.75 as a rasult and print it.

# %%
# Using 4 mathematical operators to achieve the result 85.75
result = (100-20) * 1.5 / 2 + 25.75
print(result)  # Output: 85.75

# %% [markdown]
# ### question 3
# 
# Use object names to keep better track of what's going on in your code!
# 
# Open new code cell below this one and assign to variables the numerical valus you use in question 2, and use them to get 85.75 and print is.
# 
# For example: 
#    
# instead:
# 
# <code>print(4\*5+3)</code>
# 
# write:
# 
# <code>a = 4</code>
# 
# <code>b = 5</code>
# 
# <code>c = 3</code>
# 
# <code>d = a*b+c</code>
# 
# <code>print(d)</code>
# 
# 

# %%
# Assigning the numerical values to variables
a = 100
b = 20
c = 1.5
d = 2
e = 25.75

# Using variables to calculate the result
f = (a - b) * c / d + e

# Printing the result
print(f)  # Output: 85.75

# %% [markdown]
# ### question 4
# assign to `a` an integer and to `b` a floa. Then write:
# ```python
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))
# ```
# what did you get?

# %%
# Write your answer here

a = 1
b = 1.0 

print(type(a))
print(type(b))

# The result is:
# <class, 'int'>
# <class, 'float'>

# %% [markdown]
# ### question 5
# assign to `c` the number 7.548796521. Use the function `round()` and explain what the function did to the variable `c`. store the answer in the variable 'd'.
# 
# Print the type of the new variable 'd'.
# 
# for explain what `round()` did open new text cell below this one and write your explanation.
# 

# %%
# Write your answer here

c = 7.548796521
d = round (c)
print(d)

# The `round()` function in Python rounds a floating-point number to the nearest integer or to a specified number of decimal places.
